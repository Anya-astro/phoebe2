# PHOEBE 2.0 BETA

PHOEBE 2.0 is a complete rewrite of PHOEBE code to handle higher precision and include new physics.  Please visit [phoebe-project.org](http://phoebe-project.org) for more information and to access the [documentation and tutorials](http://phoebe-project.org/docs/2.0b).

**WARNING**: this is the beta-release of PHOEBE 2.0.  As soon as the paper is refereed and accepted for publication,
we will release the offical (and tested) version of PHOEBE 2.0.  Until then, some changes may need to be made
that could break backwards-compatibility, and using this release for science should be used with extreme caution.

For the stable version, please use [PHOEBE 1.0](http://phoebe-project.org/1.0).
